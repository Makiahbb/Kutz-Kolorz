{instructions:
"The only thing that will be different from that lesson, is the inclusion of a README file. 
For the competition you will use this file to brag on yourself! 
State all of your names and your school and let us know what each of you worked on. 
Especially include details where you went above and beyond for the project. 
Did you have any difficult problems that you had to overcome? 
Did you create custom images or videos for your client? 
Did you discover that you love coding? 
Let the judges know! 
There are no requirements for this section other than your name and your school, but it is to your advantage to give a little information about yourself."

We'll delete this bit in brackets before turning in.}
