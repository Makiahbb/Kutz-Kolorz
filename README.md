{instructions:
"The only thing that will be different from that lesson, is the inclusion of a README file. 
For the competition you will use this file to brag on yourself! 
State all of your names and your school and let us know what each of you worked on. 
Especially include details where you went above and beyond for the project. 
Did you have any difficult problems that you had to overcome? 
Did you create custom images or videos for your client? 
Did you discover that you love coding? 
Let the judges know! 
There are no requirements for this section other than your name and your school, but it is to your advantage to give a little information about yourself."

We'll delete this bit in brackets before turning in.}

Im Eli Eberle and the team lead for CTCTOAA. I origionally took Coding out of appreciation for my Computer Applications teacher, but a few weeks into Coding realized how great of a decision I made. I was responsible for choosing Kutz & Kolorz for this project because time and time again they do my hair perfectly.
During this project I've done the following: Navbar, Footer, All of Index besides pink lines and title layout, All of Scheduling, All of Services besides filling in the menu's info, All of Gallery, All images besides the ones on Products page, All of About, Background image, Setting up all pages (doctype, css link, bootstrap link), Javascript file, and Client consultation.
The biggest challenge throughout the entire project was responsiveness. At first my solution was translating px into vw but that didn't quite do it. The final solution for me that made all of my responsiveness work was a combination of sizing with vw and adding a max-width %. The Gallery especially was especially nasty to resize, but the Gallery was still the most fun page to make, especially the Table of Contents jumping you down to specific content on the page and the JavaScript Back to Top button. That's all from me.
