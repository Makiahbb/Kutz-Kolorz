Eli Eberle

Im Eli Eberle and the team lead for CTCTOAA. I origionally took Coding out of appreciation for my Computer Applications teacher, but a few weeks into Coding realized how great of a decision I made. I was responsible for choosing Kutz & Kolorz for this project because time and time again they do my hair perfectly.<br>
During this project I've done the following: Navbar, Footer, All of Index besides pink lines and title layout, All of Scheduling, All of Services besides filling in the menu's info, All of Gallery, All images besides the ones on Products page, All of About, Background image, Setting up all pages (doctype, css link, bootstrap link), Javascript file, and all Client consultation.<br>
The biggest challenge throughout the entire project was responsiveness. At first my solution was translating px into vw but that didn't quite do it. The final solution for me that made all of my responsiveness work was a combination of sizing with vw and adding a max-width %. The Gallery was especially nasty to resize, but the Gallery was still the most fun page to make. That's all from me.

My name is Makiah Burns, I am a student at Madison Academic. I did the Product page, subtitles, service content & gallery descriptions. My biggest problem was alignment. I did margins & positions. Positioning worked better for me.
